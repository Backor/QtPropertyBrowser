This is a Qt Designer plugin for the Qt Solutions QtPropertyBrowser.
This version of the plugin is compatible with Qt 5.7.  

The QtPropertyBrowser and this plugin were built on a Linux Mint 17 machine
with Qt 5.7.

To build this plugin on your 'Linux machine':
    * make sure that QtPropertyBrowser has been built
    * `cd` into the `plugin` directory
    * run `qmake` to build the Makefile, then
    * run `make` to build the plugin

Once the plugin is built, open your Qt Designer, and your plugin should appear
at the bottom of your Widget Box.

Drag and drop your chose propertybrowser style onto your workspace window.
For the qtbuttonpropertybrowser and the qtgroupboxproperty browser, you might
want to check the 'autoFillBackground' in Designer's Property Editor.
From here on I think we just have to add items to your propertybrowser widget
with code.

NOTE:
    I thought that using the QtPropertyBrowser's .so library would be all we
    needed to get the plugin working correctly, but I actually had to include
    all of the .h and .cpp files from the QtPropertyBrowser/src in order for the
    plugin to build and work in the Designer.  Feel free to share if anyone has
    thoughts or comments on this.
